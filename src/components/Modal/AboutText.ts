const aboutText = `Hi, Iâ€™m Madison ðŸ‘‹

I started out in mechatronics engineering, got very attached to Java, and now spend most of my time wrangling React, TypeScript, and Kotlin (plus the occasional existential crisis). I like writing APIs, mentoring junior devs, and explaining why things are broken â€” gently, and usually with a diagram.

I like my systems robust, my code readable, and my Monster Energy drinks in bulk (thank you Costco). Iâ€™m most at home untangling legacy chaos, streamlining workflows, and trying to make sense of Splunk logs that seem personally offended by clarity.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m probably baking, buying another indoor plant I donâ€™t need, or talking to my cat like heâ€™s a coworker. His name is Guts, and he has opinions.

If somethingâ€™s worth doing, itâ€™s probably worth over-engineering. Or at least wrapping in a try-catch. ðŸ«
